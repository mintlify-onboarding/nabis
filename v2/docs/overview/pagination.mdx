title: "Pagination"
---

Some requests can contain thousands of records. We paginate our responses, requiring you to make multiple API calls to get the data.

tip

This APIs pagination is **0-index based**, much like looking up an array via index notation. All pages start at `0`.

tip

For a paginated endpoint, both `page` and `limit` are required query parameters.

Consider calling `GET /order?page=0&limit=100`

```
{
  "data": [],
  "page": 0,
  "totalCount": 4200,
  "totalNumPages": 42,
  "nextPage": 1,
  "prevPage": null
}

```

You will notice we return a couple of items that make it easy to determine how many requests you need to make to capture all the data.

### `totalCount`[](#totalcount "Direct link to heading")

With this field we now tell you how many records your query is going to return. And from there with your `limit` input, we can easily calculate the `totalNumPages`to vastly improve the pagination experience.

### `totalNumPages`[](#totalnumpages "Direct link to heading")

With API paging starting at page `0`, `totalNumPages` will maintain paging correctness.

An example of correctness with 0 index-based paging would be with `42` actual pages,`totalNumPages` would return `41` because of page `0`.

Once you have a single page, it will display `totalNumPages: 1` instead of `0`, because page `0` is a valid page.

---

### `nextPage` and `prevPage`[](#nextpage-and-prevpage "Direct link to heading")

If you called with the query parameter `page=0` then `prevPage` would be `null`. If you called with`page=42` then `nextPage` would be `null`.
