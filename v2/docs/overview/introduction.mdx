title: "Getting started with the REST API"
description: Let's walk through core API concepts as we tackle some every day use cases. You will first need to [generate an API key](/v2/docs/overview/generating-api-key).
---

## Overview[](#overview "Direct link to heading")

We are curing to use [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/). If you are using an alternative client, ensure that you are able to send the required [User Agent header](/v2/docs/overview/authentication) in each request.

## Hello, World! :D[](#hello-world-d "Direct link to heading")

[Generate an API key](/v2/docs/overview/generating-api-key) and let's get started by testing our setup.

```bash
$ curl -H "x-nabis-access-token: <access-token>" \
  https://platform-api.nabis.pro/v2/nabis-days-off
>
> [
>   {
>     "date":"2022-01-01",
>     "description":"This year's New Years Day"
>   },
>   ...
> ]%   

```

Let's add the `-i` flag to include headers:

```bash
$ curl -i -H "x-nabis-access-token: <access-token>" \
  https://platform-api.nabis.pro/v2/nabis-days-off

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Date: Sun, 07 Aug 2022 11:15:14 GMT
> Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
> Content-Length: 517
> Connection: keep-alive
> X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
> X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
> Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
> Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
> ETag: W/"205-tARba5EOhSEMX2NJJ33BWs9hg5I"
>
> [{
>   "date":"2022-01-01",
>   "description":"This year's New Years Day"
> }, ...]%

```

There are some interesting bits in the response. As we expected, the `Content-Type` is `application/json`.

Headers beginning with `X-` are custom headers and are not included in the HTTP spec. For example, this API leverages the header `x-nabis-access-token` for [authentication](/v2/docs/overview/authentication).

## Making a call[](#making-a-call "Direct link to heading")

To get a list of orders for your organization, call `GET /orders`, but remember `/orders` is paginated so we will receive a paginated response body with additional data about our request so we know how many calls to make in order to fetch all of the data we want.

Keep in mind that both `limit` and `page` are required query parameters for `/orders`. If we don't supply both with our query, we will be returned a `400` error - `Bad request exception`.

### Get the firt page, page 0[](#get-the-firt-page-page-0 "Direct link to heading")

```bash
$ curl -H "x-nabis-access-token: <access-token>" \
  https://platform-api.nabis.pro/v2/orders?page=0&limit=100
>
> {
>   "data": [{
>     "id": "544e23bc-563e-402a-8b43-126656377d89", ...
>   }],
>   "page": 1,
>   "totalCount" 1152,
>   "totalNumPages": 11,
>   "nextPage": 2,
>   "prevPage": 0
> }%

```

### Get the second page, page 1[](#get-the-second-page-page-1 "Direct link to heading")

```bash
$ curl -H "x-nabis-access-token: <access-token>" \
  https://platform-api.nabis.pro/v2/orders?page=1&limit=100
>
> {
>   "data": [{
>     "id": "70e2be90-1662-49ab-85b3-8c92499c55ef", ...
>   }],
>   "page": 1,
>   "totalCount" 1152,
>   "totalNumPages": 11,
>   "nextPage": 2,
>   "prevPage": 0
> }%

```

### Get the last page, page 11[](#get-the-last-page-page-11 "Direct link to heading")

```bash
$ curl -H "x-nabis-access-token: <access-token>" \
  https://platform-api.nabis.pro/v2/orders?page=11&limit=100
>
> {
>   "data": [{
>     "id": "350bb797-a976-4f01-962d-63da5d41a50e", ...
>   }],
>   "page": 11,
>   "totalCount" 1152,
>   "totalNumPages": 11,
>   "nextPage": null,
>   "prevPage": 10
> }%

```
